Prim’s Algorithm

Prim’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.

Prim’s algorithm is a powerful tool in graph theory, useful for optimizing network wiring, data clustering
